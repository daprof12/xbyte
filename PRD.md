# Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**Product Name:** Xbyte Multi-Chain Wallet (Web Extension + PWA)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Target Launch:** Q2 2026  

### 1. Product Overview & Vision  
Xbyte Multi-Chain Wallet is a **non-custodial** browser extension + Progressive Web App (PWA) that starts as a beautiful, fast, multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet supporting **BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB Smart Chain, TRON (for USDT)** by default, with ability to add any EVM or non-EVM chain later.

The product will have **two completely separate sides**:

- **User-facing side** (non-custodial wallet + PWA + extension) → similar UI/UX to https://klever.io/extension/  
- **Admin dashboard** (fully custodial control panel) → allows the company to act as a centralized operator (KYC wallet service model)

> **Critical Note:** This PRD describes a **hybrid custodial / non-custodial** model. The user side behaves like Phantom/Solana (private keys encrypted locally), but the admin panel has full override capability (can modify balances, block users, etc.). This is legally a **custodial wallet service** despite the user seeing "non-custodial" messaging.

### 2. Target Users  
1. Crypto beginners in emerging markets (Africa, LATAM, SEA)  
2. Users who want one wallet for BTC + ETH + SOL + BNB + USDT  
3. Users who trust a centralized company more than pure self-custody  
4. Companies needing admin oversight (corporate treasury, exchanges, payment processors)

### 4. System Architecture

**Frontend**  
- React + Vite + TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS + Headless UI  
- Zustand for state management  
- i18next for multilingual  
- Manifest v3 Chrome Extension + PWA  

**Backend (Node.js + Express OR NestJS)**  
- REST + WebSocket API  
- Authentication: JWT + Admin 2FA (Google Authenticator)  

**Storage (File-based – NO traditional database)**  
As per requirement: **Everything stored in encrypted JSON files on server filesystem**  
Structure example:

```
/data/
  users/
    user_{id}.json.enc          ← encrypted with AES-256-GCM
  assets/
    supported_assets.json
  transactions/
    tx_{hash}.json
  admin_logs/
    2025-11-27.json
  config/
    fees.json
    admin_users.json
```

- Encryption key stored in AWS Secrets Manager / Hashicorp Vault (never in repo)  
- All writes are atomic (write temp → rename)  
- Daily backup to S3 + Glacier  
- Search/lookup via in-memory index (loaded at server start)

**Third-party APIs**  
- CoinGecko / Coinglass – live prices  
- 1inch / Jupiter – swap routing  
- MoonPay / Transak / Ramp – fiat on-ramp  
- Blockcipher / Tatum / Moralist – address generation & tx broadcasting (fallback)  
- Twilio – SMS/WhatsApp  
- SendGrid / Resend – Email  

### 5. Database Schema (File-Based JSON Examples)

**user_{id}.json (encrypted)**  
```json
{
  "id": "usr_12345",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "phone": "+234...",
  "kyc_status": "verified",
  "created_at": "2025-11-27T10:00:00Z",
  "blocked": false,
  "mnemonic_encrypted": "U2FsdGVkX1+...",   // encrypted with user PIN-derived key
  "addresses": {
    "BTC": "bc1q...",
    "ETH": "0x...",
    "SOL": "sol...",
    "BNB": "bnb1...",
    "USDT_TRC20": "T..."
  },
  "balances": {
    "BTC": "0.005",
    "ETH": "2.45",
    "SOL": "15.0",
    "BNB": "3.2",
    "USDT": "1250.00"
  },
  "custom_tokens": [...]
}
```

**fees.json**  
```json
{
  "BTC": { "withdraw_fee": "0.0005", "percent": "0.5" },
  "ETH": { "gas_multiplier": 1.2 },
  "SOL": { "priority_fee_micro_lamports": 10000 }
}
```

### 6. PWA & Extension Installation

- Manifest.json with "display": "standalone"  
- Service Worker for offline caching  
- "BeforeInstallPrompt" handling → custom install button  
- Chrome Web Store + Firefox Add-ons submission  
- Direct .crx / .xpi download (sideloading)  

### 7. Security & Compliance Considerations

- Admin panel runs on separate subdomain with strict CORS  
- Rate limiting + Cloudflare WAF  
- All file writes go through a single service with audit logging  
- User private keys never touch backend (only encrypted blob)  
- Legal structure: The company is the custodian → must comply with financial regulations in operating jurisdictions (e.g., VASP license if targeting Europe)

### 8. Launch MVP Scope (8–10 weeks)

| Week | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| 1–2  | UI/UX design (exact Klever clone + dark mode) |
| 3–5  | Extension + PWA frontend (onboarding + wallet functions) |
| 4–6  | File-based backend + admin CRUD |
| 6–7  | Admin dashboard (balance override, user block, fees) |
| 7–8  | Communication (Email/SMS/WhatsApp) + support tickets |
| 8–9  | Swap & Buy integration + QR scanner |
| 9–10 | Testing, audit, launch |

This PRD gives you a complete blueprint to build a Phantom-style multi-chain wallet with full admin custodial control, Klever-like landing page, PWA capabilities, and file-based storage as requested.

Let me know if you want Figma designs, API spec (OpenAPI), or detailed file encryption module next.
