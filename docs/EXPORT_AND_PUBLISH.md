# Exporting from Figma Make and Publishing to App Stores

## Current Situation

You're developing in **Figma Make** (web-based React environment).

**What you CAN'T do from here:**
- ❌ Build iOS apps (requires macOS + Xcode)
- ❌ Build Android apps (requires Android Studio)
- ❌ Submit to App Store (requires Mac)
- ❌ Submit to Play Store (requires signing tools)

**What you CAN do:**
- ✅ Download all your code
- ✅ Set up locally on your computer
- ✅ Build and publish from there

---

## Step-by-Step: From Here to App Stores

### **Phase 1: Export Your Code (5 minutes)**

#### **Option A: Download as ZIP**

1. Look for "Export" or "Download" button in Figma Make
2. Download all files as ZIP
3. Extract to your computer

#### **Option B: Manual Copy (if no export)**

Since you have access to all files, you'll need to:

1. **Create a new folder on your computer:**
   ```bash
   mkdir xbyte-wallet
   cd xbyte-wallet
   ```

2. **Initialize a new React project:**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
   ```

3. **Copy all your files manually:**
   - Copy all `/components/*.tsx` files
   - Copy all `/utils/*.ts` files
   - Copy all `/hooks/*.ts` files
   - Copy `/App.tsx`
   - Copy `/styles/globals.css`
   - Copy all `/public/*` files
   - Copy any other custom files

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install lucide-react recharts react-slick
   # Add all other packages you used
   ```

5. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Open http://localhost:5173
   # Verify everything works
   ```

---

### **Phase 2: Set Up Your Local Environment**

#### **For iOS (Requires Mac):**

**Requirements:**
- 💻 **Mac computer** (MacBook, iMac, Mac Mini)
  - Cannot build iOS apps on Windows or Linux
  - Need macOS 12.0 or later
  
**Install Required Software:**

1. **Xcode** (Free, ~12GB)
   ```bash
   # Download from Mac App Store
   # Or: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
   
   # After install, run:
   sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
   ```

2. **Node.js** (if not installed)
   ```bash
   # Download from https://nodejs.org
   # Or use Homebrew:
   brew install node
   ```

3. **CocoaPods** (iOS dependency manager)
   ```bash
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```

#### **For Android (Works on Mac, Windows, Linux):**

**Install Required Software:**

1. **Android Studio** (Free, ~3GB)
   - Download: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Install and run
   - Follow setup wizard
   - Install Android SDK (API 33)

2. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   ```bash
   # Mac:
   brew install openjdk@17
   
   # Windows:
   # Download from https://adoptium.net/
   
   # Linux:
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables (Windows/Linux):**
   ```bash
   # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc (Mac/Linux)
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
   
   # Windows: Set in System Environment Variables
   ANDROID_HOME=C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
   ```

---

### **Phase 3: Install Capacitor (10 minutes)**

Once your code is running locally:

```bash
# 1. Install Capacitor
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npm install @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android
npm install @capacitor/preferences

# 2. Initialize Capacitor
npx cap init
# App name: Xbyte Multi-Chain Wallet
# App ID: com.xbytewallet.app (use your own)
# Web directory: dist

# 3. Add platforms
npx cap add ios      # Mac only
npx cap add android  # Any OS

# 4. Build your React app
npm run build

# 5. Sync to native projects
npx cap sync
```

---

### **Phase 4: Update Code for Native (2-4 hours)**

You need to replace `localStorage` with native storage.

**1. Create `/utils/platform.ts`:**

```typescript
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';
import { Preferences } from '@capacitor/preferences';

export const isNative = Capacitor.isNativePlatform();
export const isIOS = Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'ios';
export const isAndroid = Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'android';

export const storage = {
  async set(key: string, value: any) {
    if (isNative) {
      await Preferences.set({
        key,
        value: JSON.stringify(value)
      });
    } else {
      localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    }
  },

  async get(key: string) {
    if (isNative) {
      const { value } = await Preferences.get({ key });
      return value ? JSON.parse(value) : null;
    } else {
      const value = localStorage.getItem(key);
      return value ? JSON.parse(value) : null;
    }
  },

  async remove(key: string) {
    if (isNative) {
      await Preferences.remove({ key });
    } else {
      localStorage.removeItem(key);
    }
  },

  async clear() {
    if (isNative) {
      await Preferences.clear();
    } else {
      localStorage.clear();
    }
  }
};
```

**2. Find all localStorage usage:**

```bash
# Search for localStorage
grep -r "localStorage" src/

# You'll find it in:
# - /utils/walletStorage.ts
# - /utils/adminStorage.ts
# - /App.tsx
# - /components/OnboardingFlow.tsx
# - /components/ImportWallet.tsx
# - etc.
```

**3. Replace in each file:**

I can help you update each file if you'd like. Would you like me to update all the files now?
